/**
 * Script transactions (set script to account) allow you to extend the available functionality
 * of the standard Waves application. One of the uses of script transaction
 * is creating a multi-signature wallet. Script can be developed
 * with [Waves Ride IDE]({https://ide.wavesplatform.com/)
 *
 * An account with the attached script is called a smart account.
 *
 * You can also cancel the active script transaction. You must send transaction with null script.
 *
 * Before you start, please keep in mind.
 * We do not recommend you submit script transactions unless you are an experienced user.
 *
 * !!! Errors can lead to permanent loss of access to your account.
 *
 * Set script transaction is used to setup an smart account,
 * The account needs to issue Set script transaction which contains the predicate.
 * Upon success, every outgoing transaction will be validated not by the default mechanism
 * of signature validation, but according to the predicate logic.
 *
 * Account script can be changed or cleared if the script installed allows
 * the new set script transaction to process. The set script transaction can be changed
 * by another set script transaction call unless itâ€™s prohibited by a previous set script.
